The above online video is given by Prof. Chen-Ning Yang. It is a worth watching video. Unfortunately, it is only offered in Mandarin. One of the interesting discussion is about the structure for physics development.

There are usually four steps 

1. Experiments
2. Phenomenological theory
3. Theoretical framework
4. Mathematics

Each parts are iterated between each other several times and eventually they are established in a self-consistent way. 

For example,

In classical mechanics, we study the dynamics of **particles** acted by forces.

1. Experiment: Observation of the orbits from earth- [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe)
2. Phenomenological theory: Kepler's laws of planetary motion- [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler)
3. Theoretical framework: Newton's law of motion- [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton)
4. Mathematics: [Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus)

In electromagnetic theory, we study the dynamics of **fields** that mediated the forces. The simplest **gauge structure** in nature.

1. Experiment:  [Coulomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb) et. al.
2. Phenomenological theory: [Michael Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday), [Andre-Marie Ampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/André-Marie_Ampère)
3. Theoretical framework: [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_equations)
4. Mathematics: [Fibre bundle?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_bundle)

In quantum mechanics, we study objects that has the dynamics that has the **particle** and **wave**  nature. A little bit of the mixture of the previous two...

2. Phenomenological theory: Planck's law- [Max Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck)
3. Theoretical framework: Quantum Mechanics- [Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg), [Erwin Schödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schrödinger), [Paul Dira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac), [Max Born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Born), etc.
4. Mathematics: [Hilbert space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space)

In thermodynamics, we study a **system with macroscopic number of degrees of freedom**.

1. Experiments: ??
2. Phenomenological theory: Thermodynamics- [Carnot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Léonard_Sadi_Carnot),[James Prescott Joule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Prescott_Joule), [Rudolf Clausius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Clausius)
3. Theoretical framework: Statistical Mechanics -[Ludwig Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann), [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell), [Josiah Willard Gibbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs) 
4. Mathematics: ? or simply too many...
