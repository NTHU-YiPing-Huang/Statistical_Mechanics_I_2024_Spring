# Exercise

This is the guide to the exercise in Statistical Mechanics (I). The mind set for the homework is not to preparing you for the exams. Instead, I hope it will guide you through a process of independent learning. Therefore, the problem sets should be kind of challenge and have some horizontal connection with different sub-fields of physics. As I mentioned, the idea is: simple but not simpler. Try to see if it is true in each problem by first identify what is the key logical foundation. Then, try to remove these foundation and see how the results changes. I hope this can be a fruitful journey for you to learn statistical mechanics. As I emphasised in the lectures again and again: the lectures/course should be the starting point to a research topic instead of the invisible ceiling for your independent learning.
