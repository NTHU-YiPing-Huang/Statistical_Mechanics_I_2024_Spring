# Numerical tools

This is a super short course to build basic numerical ability using the python language which is accessible for everyone. The tutorial is based on the tutorial of ICTP 2018 summer school given by Christ Laumann.

There are several useful materials online. Also, we know google is a good friend for all of us. There are just too many documentation for python and its packages. I just list some of them below.

 - [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/)
 - [Python Scientific Lecture Notes](http://scipy-lectures.github.io/index.html) 
 - [A Crash Course in Python for Scientists](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rpmuller/5920182)

The numerical tool is useful for us to develop some intuition about what is going on. Also, it is also complementary to the analytic approach. When the analytic approach is not available, we can try the numerical approach. Therefore, from pedagogical and practical point of view, it is important to have some numerical tools at hand to explore/learn statistical mechanics.
